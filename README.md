👋 Hi, I’m @hanraywon

🧠 I tinker with physics, code, and web stuff — mostly for fun, always with curiosity  
🐍 Learning Python on the side, chasing ways to live smarter, not harder  
🛠️ Most of what I build is solo — messy sometimes, but always mine  
🎯 I enjoy turning random ideas into actual tools, even small ones  
📬 Reach me on Instagram: @_raywon
